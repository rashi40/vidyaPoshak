The distinct parameters of FoCh is Personal Mentoring: We have believed and also realised that mentoring students and spending time with them is critical to their progress. Our aim is to be much more than a funding organisation, and therefore we try to provide the students as much personal attention as possible.

Placing need ahead of marks: We have consciously not made marks a criteria for supporting a student, and focussed on the need and inclination. If there are opportunities for higher education, we try to ensure that they are fully utilised by our students, regardless of their scores.</p>
